# Welcome to my website

I am a Professor of Law at Queen Mary University of London (https://www.qmul.ac.uk/).  My main area of research interest is constitutional law (UK, EU and comparative) with a particular interest in direct democracy, and UK, EU and comparative foreign relations law. At Queen Mary University of London I teach constitutional law (UK Public Law), comparative constitutional law and European Union law, and also supervise doctoral research in these areas.    

I graduated with a first class degree in Law and Politics from Queen Mary University of London. I was awarded the Drapers’ Scholarship to study at the College of William and Mary in Virginia where I  completed an LLM in American Legal Studies. I continued my graduate study at the University of Oxford, where I was awarded a distinction on the BCL programme (and the Vinerian Scholarship Proxime Accessit). I completed my PhD at the European University Institute in Florence under the supervision of Professor Gráinne de Búrca. I was awarded a Post-Graduate Certificate in Academic Practice with distinction by Queen Mary University of London and I am a fellow of the Higher Education Academy.

I have spent periods as a visiting academic at the University of Oxford (Institute of European and Comparative Law), University of Cambridge (Centre for European Legal Studies), the University of Michigan’s Law School, and the University of Zurich (Centre for Research on Direct Democracy).
